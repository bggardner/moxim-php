The Modular eXtensible Information Modeler (MoXIM) is a database
structure and servicing layer that creates a balance between
performance and flexibility.  It can be implemented as a wrapper
around an existing database to create dynamic relationships.

The original XIM (see link below) was a purely relational database
that essentially had no predefined structure.  All "nodes" and the
relationships between them were stored in very large tables.  Node
types and relationships types were dynamically generated, making
it extremely flexible.

MoXIM has the same flexibility of XIM, but allows for predefined
tables, or "modules".  Predefined primary/foreign key relationships
can be utilized between modules to improve clarity and performance,
while dynamic relationships are provided by the MoXIM service layer.

See MoXIM_Database_Layout.pdf for an example MoXIM database layout.

moxim-php provides a PHP service layer for a MoXIM-ized database.
